  # Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker


  ## Description:
  A Node.js command-line application takes user input to generate a logo and saves it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

  ## Contributing:
  I used all of the bootcamp resources to create this application (tutors, learning assistance and classwork.)
  
  ## Known issues:
  Time permitting, I will circle back to this project to figure out why the text does not appear in the SVG file. Could it simply be the viewer?
